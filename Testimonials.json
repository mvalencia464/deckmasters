      "text": "We recently completed a very large, complex project with Deckmasters. Like any project of this size, there were challenges along the way, but I can confidently say we are incredibly satisfied with the end result and would highly recommend them.\n\nOur original scope was already ambitious: replacing our second-story wraparound deck, replacing the deck over our garage, and adding a brand-new first-floor deck with stairs connecting the two levels. Partway through, we expanded the project to include replacing all the exterior siding of our home, which was long overdue for repairs. These improvements were critical for both the safety of our kids and the longevity of our home.\n\nNaturally, a project of this size came with its share of hurdles—delays with siding and materials, a septic system replacement (which we handled separately), and, most significantly, discovering major water damage and black mold in the garage walls once the old deck was removed. Deckmasters stepped up in a huge way. They reconstructed the walls of our garage (remarkably without removing the interior drywall or garage doors) saving us significant time and cost. They also rebuilt the garage roof and ensured everything was structurally sound for the long term.\n\nWhat stood out most was their attention to detail and the work ethic of their crew. Absolutely 10/10. They were respectful, hardworking, and clearly cared about the quality of their work. Communication wasn’t perfect at every stage, but whenever we raised concerns, the team responded with ownership and genuine effort to resolve the issue. To improve things, they even set up weekly in-person check-ins with us, which went a long way in my book. Their commitment to doing the best job possible was evident throughout this entire experience.\n\nWe’d like to give a special shoutout to Sean, who not only treated our home as if it were his own but also personally repaired the serious issues with our garage roof and walls like a real-life magician. On top of that, he quickly became a favorite of our dogs, delivering daily attention and treats. :) It may seem like a simple thing, but our dogs are part of our family and we noticed his care for them. Jordan Webb handled some of the hardest points of the project with humility. After a roofer left us in the lurch with a sub-par job and an exposed roof in the rain, I had a full-blown anxiety attack. Jordan listened, let me vent and cry, apologized, and quickly brought in a new roofer who finished the job correctly. His integrity and the pride he takes in his work is clear, and his focus on details that affected the safety of our kids meant a lot to us.\n\nJustin deserves huge credit for meticulously replacing our siding, soffit, and fascia. Our house is an odd shape with tricky angles, but he measured and cut everything with precision so the new materials fit beautifully. He even adjusted deck boards on our back deck after I pointed out that a gap between the deck and the house wasn’t perfectly parallel (small details that made a big difference in the finished product). Robert, Quillin, and Cameron were wizards when it came to finishing touches—replacing scratched boards, repairing minor details we flagged and then some, and framing our lower deck with real craftsmanship.\n\nAbove all, every single member of this crew was kind and respectful. That goes a long way in my book. Big projects are never perfect, but Deckmasters proved themselves to be problem-solvers who care deeply about both their craft and their clients. We’re grateful for all their hard work and proud of the home we now have because of them.",

We had some issues with communication initially with an employee that is no longer in the role, but Jordan, Andrew, and Jackie were able to straighten everything out before the scheduled date the project was set to begin. Even companies that perform at a high level end up going through some rough spots, and in my opinion it's not whether or not those rough spots happen, but how they handle them. Deck Masters handled it fantastically.\n\nI had a simple small 2nd floor back deck that needed to be replaced, ours was original from 45yrs ago, and was in awful condition. Their demo crew came out and had it down in about an hour, and the trash gone 30min later. About 2 weeks later, their build crew came out, and had the deck done in less than 24hrs. Now my wife and I will need our front deck redone just to match! Thank you guys for helping us out. We love the New Deck.",

I use it everyday on my arthritic body and it makes me feel great. I highly recommend these people if you are serious about purchasing a hot tub. Update, the valve that controls one side of the tubs jets broke and even though Family Pool is not a Marquis dealer they got me a replacement valve so I could repair it myself. Great people 👍",

Would recommend them to anyone in the valley who is needing pool and or spa services.",

The frame had snapped because the brackets were installed against the edge of the tub, and there wasn't enough overlap of the frame tubes (strengthening the frame).  I shifted the brackets over per the manufacturers guideline and wow, it's not so flimsy when installed correctly.  I now have holes in the panel where they had incorrectly installed the brackets.\n\nI went in to ask about the issue and if there was anything to be done.  They told me the owner wasn't around, and to call back.\n\nI called 3 times, left messages, never received another response from a manager, or the owner.",

We made eye contact and even said hello. She never got up from her desk or even said, \"someone will be with you shortly.\" Terrible customer service. How do you not acknowledge customers when they come into your business? Your loss. We took our business to another pool installer who appreciates their customers and their business, and actually gets up and acknowledges them when they walk through the front door. If you can't even acknowledge people when they walk through your door, it kind of makes you wonder what kind of service (or lack therof) they provide when installing a pool...definitely would NOT recommend.",

There is the big value:  a relationship to help you partner in keeping a happy healthy pool. They are not there to just sell you products they really are subject matter experts. They educate, coach, and have the products & services I need.  Just grab a water sample and take it to their store. See for yourself.",

I was contacted by Mike, the owner of Family Pool & Spa and was told he is the local dealer and would inform me when the spa arrived and would schedule a delivery.  Once the spa arrived and the delivery scheduled, Mike and his crew arrived on schedule at my home and had the spa up and running in short order.  However a the next day I noticed a leak on the patio from the tub.  I informed Mike and he and his brother Randal came right over and attempted to fix the leak.  After two separate attempts, Mike called the LA Spa regional rep in Seattle.  Mike said that it was extremely rare to have an LA Spa leak but that he would have the factory in Chandler, AZ build an exact replacement on a RUSH order.  Again, when the tub arrived in Boise, Mike and his crew removed the original tub and installed the replacement.  All is well and the tube works perfectly and has no leaks.  It even has the latest topside digital screen control.  My hat of to Mike and Family Pool and Spa for excellent, prompt and professional sales and service.  A big THANK YOU!!",

Mike has many years experience as a spa and pool tech and has worked multiple years for various notable spa companies, so it was became quickly evident after speaking with him that he really knows the technology and business. He could mention notable differences between all notable hot tub brands out there.\n\nOther local spa stores we stopped at quoted us a higher retail price in person but when we left, offered us discount incentives after to lure us back in. This was not the case with Family Pool and Spa, they cut out the haggle and offered us their best competitive pricing for each model.\n\nIn addition to working with us on the install, Family Pool and Spa has been extremely responsive with any followup help we have needed. I have  contacted them multiple times to learn more about which chemicals to add when. Also, they will test your water sample for free and tell you exactly how to resolve any water chemistry issues.

That said, our expectations were high and Mike at Family Pool and Spa exceeded every single one of them.

Every part of our experience from choosing the tub, waiting for it to arrive ( which happened quickly), the installation, and the up-keep have gone better than we ever imagined and I would HIGHLY recommend Family Pool and Spa to anyone seeking a pool or Hot tub for their family.
