      "text": "We were asked to give an honest review of our new deck that was recently finished by Deck Masters. OK!\nFirst and foremost, we are so happy with our new deck and how it turned out.  As a homeowner you always wonder how a big project like this will turn out when you're in the long planning/waiting phase.  These guys nailed it, truly.  The railing system we had installed is truly stunning! Shoutout to Sean who was especially awesome and showed a very professional demeanor, he even asked to come work on the weekend to help finish our deck railing on time(Thank you!).  We had a deck board that we found had been damaged, and a piece of trim we wanted fixed.  They made it known that it would be quickly/happily fixed which they did! Deck 5 out of 5 stars.\nWe were originally told our project would start late July with the possibility of it starting sooner when we put our deposit down in May.  We had not heard anything last week of July so I reached out and was told they were running behind and it wouldn't be til late august.  We were frustrated and decided to cancel the project because we figured it was to late in the summer that we wouldn't be able to enjoy it.  I quickly received a call from the owner Jordan who was apologetic and assured me our project was next and would start in a few days.  He mentioned that our project would take about a week to a week and a half.  We decided to continue with the project.  They did start the project just a few days later.\nOur deck took nearly six weeks from start to finish.  There was spans of several days and even well over a week where we wouldn't hear from or see anyone during this time.  Prompting us to reach out and get an update several times.  We were usually told that they were waiting on supplies or needed to order something else.  We started to feel like the planning was either last minute for the orders or they just had bitten off more than they could chew with projects this year.\nOur advice?  Most customers realize how much things can change with deadlines, material, etc.  It's easier for us to be flexible if you keep us in the loop, even with the smallest details.\nThanks again for our wonderful new deck.  Would definitely use Deck Masters again.\n\n*EDIT*\nWas called personally by the owner, Jordan shortly after this review.  It's obvious how important customer satisfaction is to him.  We had a nice conversation and he took full credit for the delays during our project, even though some of the items were out of his control (Spenard Builders Supply closing one of their locations this summer creating serious issues with product availability) and he made NO excuses.  Thanks for driving out to our home, and thank you for the nice mug!",

No shows on bids, \"I'll get back with you\" comments, we are booked, etc. etc. I called Deck Masters. A representative came within a few days, made a rough drawing with dimensions and gave me preliminary suggestions and ideas. A short time later I received a bid (lower than most big box stores) with a detailed explanation of construction steps, fees, lumber sizes, supports required, and a lot of other detailed information. I was amazed at the details. I accepted the contract and set a completion date. The work was truly amazing. The old deck was removed with no damage to the existing house, and all was hauled away. A framework was constructed that looked bomb proof. When the Trex decking was applied it truly became a masterpiece with their picture frame method. When the railing was added the deck became a work of art. I was totally satisfied that all my questions had been answered patiently. Any suggestions I had were considered. If I wanted something that was not construction worthy, the lead worker let me know and explained why. All of the workers appeared highly trained and aware of their responsibilities. The office was in contact with me during construction and boosted my confidence. When the deck was completed, I was sort of glad that all the previous contractors had dropped out, maybe that was good. The new deck has enhanced the appearance of my home. I highly recommend folks take their time with a deck project to insure they get the best. That is what I got with Deck Masters AK.",

Our project involved replacing a small second-story deck with a much larger one made from Trex, which was no small feat given the complexities of permitting, tight utility corridors, and the installation of pilings.\n\nDespite these challenges, Jordan and his team delivered a beautiful result. Our new deck receives compliments constantly from neighbors and passersby. Moreover, they stood by their warranty and replaced a center support beam that had developed a large crack. Although the crack did not compromise the integrity of the beam, they wanted to ensure our complete satisfaction and replaced it without hesitation.\n\nWe highly recommend Jordan and his team for their professionalism, craftsmanship, and dedication to customer satisfaction.",

Along with that, the owner made sure that we were happy with the job and even checked the work as well.  I will definitely be contacting them again in the future!",

      "text": "Via a referral, and after researching a few other deck builders, I contacted Jordan Webb at Deck Masters, formally Two Seasons.  My first hint of the type business Jordan was running was when I was greeted with an immediate response requesting a meeting at the house so he could get a feel for what my wife and would like to have done. No other builder responded to that point, and when they did they basically said for what I wanted done they didn't need to visit the site. Needless to say, I wasn't comfortable with that. Man am I glad Jordan reached out. From the beginning Jordan explained what would happen and what we could expect. It was that way through the whole build. Pretty much right away, when our old deck was demoed and hauled away, they found some water damage under the vinyl siding of the house. They pointed out the problem area and told me they could fix if I wanted it done. They also did some math and explained that if I was ok with it, they could lower the deck where it connected to the house saving material while providing a little relief to my wallet in the process. This type of interaction took place throughout the entire build and I can't stress enough how much this was appreciated. By the time they finished and moved on I felt as though I made some new friends as opposed to a business contact. You simply can't beat that in todays world. I would like to extend a special thank you to Mathew and Trey for the work and attention to detail they provided. I HIGHLY recommend Deck Masters Alaska if you're looking to add a deck to your home. It simply turned out beautiful and right on the money for what we had pictured in our mind prior meeting these gentlemen.",

      "text": "We recently completed a very large, complex project with Deckmasters. Like any project of this size, there were challenges along the way, but I can confidently say we are incredibly satisfied with the end result and would highly recommend them.\n\nOur original scope was already ambitious: replacing our second-story wraparound deck, replacing the deck over our garage, and adding a brand-new first-floor deck with stairs connecting the two levels. Partway through, we expanded the project to include replacing all the exterior siding of our home, which was long overdue for repairs. These improvements were critical for both the safety of our kids and the longevity of our home.\n\nNaturally, a project of this size came with its share of hurdles—delays with siding and materials, a septic system replacement (which we handled separately), and, most significantly, discovering major water damage and black mold in the garage walls once the old deck was removed. Deckmasters stepped up in a huge way. They reconstructed the walls of our garage (remarkably without removing the interior drywall or garage doors) saving us significant time and cost. They also rebuilt the garage roof and ensured everything was structurally sound for the long term.\n\nWhat stood out most was their attention to detail and the work ethic of their crew. Absolutely 10/10. They were respectful, hardworking, and clearly cared about the quality of their work. Communication wasn’t perfect at every stage, but whenever we raised concerns, the team responded with ownership and genuine effort to resolve the issue. To improve things, they even set up weekly in-person check-ins with us, which went a long way in my book. Their commitment to doing the best job possible was evident throughout this entire experience.\n\nWe’d like to give a special shoutout to Sean, who not only treated our home as if it were his own but also personally repaired the serious issues with our garage roof and walls like a real-life magician. On top of that, he quickly became a favorite of our dogs, delivering daily attention and treats. :) It may seem like a simple thing, but our dogs are part of our family and we noticed his care for them. Jordan Webb handled some of the hardest points of the project with humility. After a roofer left us in the lurch with a sub-par job and an exposed roof in the rain, I had a full-blown anxiety attack. Jordan listened, let me vent and cry, apologized, and quickly brought in a new roofer who finished the job correctly. His integrity and the pride he takes in his work is clear, and his focus on details that affected the safety of our kids meant a lot to us.\n\nJustin deserves huge credit for meticulously replacing our siding, soffit, and fascia. Our house is an odd shape with tricky angles, but he measured and cut everything with precision so the new materials fit beautifully. He even adjusted deck boards on our back deck after I pointed out that a gap between the deck and the house wasn’t perfectly parallel (small details that made a big difference in the finished product). Robert, Quillin, and Cameron were wizards when it came to finishing touches—replacing scratched boards, repairing minor details we flagged and then some, and framing our lower deck with real craftsmanship.\n\nAbove all, every single member of this crew was kind and respectful. That goes a long way in my book. Big projects are never perfect, but Deckmasters proved themselves to be problem-solvers who care deeply about both their craft and their clients. We’re grateful for all their hard work and proud of the home we now have because of them.",
