# Meta Ads Execution Guide: The "Andromeda" Protocol

**Objective:** Scale lead generation for Deck Masters AK to $50k+/month using high-volume creative testing.
**Primary Metric:** Cost Per Lead (CPL). Target: <$45.

## 1. Campaign Structure (The "Andromeda" Setup)

### Campaign Level
*   **Objective:** Leads (Instant Forms are priority; Website Conversions as secondary).
*   **Special Ad Category:** None (Housing is usually for real estate/rentals, but monitor this. If flagged, enable it).
*   **Budget Type:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Testing):** ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) to force equal spend across angles.
    *   **Phase 2 (Scaling):** CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) to let Meta allocate budget to winners.

### Ad Set Level (Audience)
*   **Location:** Anchorage, Eagle River, Chugiak, Girdwood (+25mi radius).
*   **Age:** 28 - 65+.
*   **Gender:** All (Except "Relief" angle -> Women Only).
*   **Targeting:** **BROAD**.
    *   *Do not* layer interests like "Home Improvement" or "Decks".
    *   Let the **Creative** do the targeting. The hook "Turn your backyard into a resort" naturally qualifies the audience.
*   **Placements:** Advantage+ Placements (Automatic). Let Meta find cheap inventory on Reels/Stories.

## 2. Creative Strategy (The "Hook Swap")

**The Golden Rule:** The first 3 seconds determine 80% of performance.

*   **Format:** 4:5 Vertical Video (for Feed) and 9:16 (for Reels/Stories). Static images are secondary.
*   **Testing Protocol:**
    1.  Select **ONE** strong angle (e.g., "Speed").
    2.  Create **ONE** core script/video body.
    3.  Generate **5 Variants** changing *only* the Hook (first 3 seconds).
    4.  Run these 5 variants in a single Ad Set.
    5.  Winner takes all budget.

**The "Andromeda" Matrix:**
*   **Angle 1 (Luxury):** Status, Pride, "Resort at Home".
*   **Angle 2 (Speed):** "21-Day Build", "Don't miss summer".
*   **Angle 3 (Trust):** "No Surprise Guarantee", "Weekly Check-ins".
*   **Angle 4 (Value):** "Investment", "Frost Heave", "Wind Ratings".
*   **Angle 5 (Relief):** "The Easy Button", "Wife's Review".

## 3. Retargeting Strategy (The "Fence Sitter" Net)

*   **Audience:**
    *   Website Visitors (last 30 days).
    *   Video Viewers (50%+ of video).
    *   Instagram/FB Engagers.
*   **Creative:**
    *   **Social Proof:** "Here's what Rachel said..." (Screenshot of review).
    *   **Objection Handling:** "Worried about cost? Here's how financing works."
    *   **Scarcity:** "Only 2 build slots left for June."

## 4. Optimization & Kill Rules

*   **Soft Kill:** If an Ad Set spends 1x target CPL ($45) with 0 leads -> **Pause**.
*   **Hard Kill:** If a Creative spends 2x target CPL ($90) with 0 leads -> **Delete**.
*   **Scale:** If an Ad Set is winning (CPL <$30), increase budget by 20% every 48 hours. Do not spike budget (it resets the learning phase).

---

## 5. Comment Management
*   **Rule:** Reply to EVERY comment.
*   **Trolls:** "Too expensive!" -> Reply: "We definitely aren't the cheapest option in town. We focus on building decks that survive Alaska winters for 20+ years. It's an investment!"
*   **Leads:** "Can you quote me?" -> Reply: "Sent you a DM! Or click the 'Get Quote' button to book a time."

---

## 6. Weekly Routine
*   **Monday:** Launch new creative tests (Hooks).
*   **Wednesday:** Kill losers (ads with high CPC/CPM and no leads).
*   **Friday:** Scale winners (bump budget for weekend traffic).
