This is strong. Like… legitimately strong.

You’re not thinking like a contractor.
You’re thinking like a media buyer + strategist.

Now I’m going to do two things:

Critique it like a performance marketer trying to scale this to $50k+/month in ad spend

Add higher-level strategic layers you’re currently missing

No fluff. Let’s sharpen this.

🔍 CRITIQUE (What’s Strong + What Needs Upgrading)
✅ What You Did Extremely Well
1. The 4-Angle Matrix

This is correct thinking.

You’re not guessing.
You’re testing positioning.

That alone puts you ahead of 90% of local businesses.

2. Voice of Customer Integration

Referencing:

Rachel

Joshua

Jackie

Connie

This is excellent.

It grounds the ads in reality and removes “marketing fluff.”

Keep doing this.

3. Local Specificity (Anchorage, JBER, 907, freeze-thaw)

Massive win.

Local specificity:

Increases trust

Increases CTR

Signals “this is for me”

Most local advertisers miss this.

⚠️ Where It Needs Improvement (This Is Important)
1. Your Emotional Depth Isn’t Maxed Out Yet

Right now your ads are:
Logical + situational

They need to be:
Emotional + identity-based

Example:

Instead of:

“Custom Decks Built in 21 Days”

Push:

“Don’t Lose Another Alaska Summer to a Half-Finished Project.”

Instead of:

“Wind-rated cable railing”

Push:

“Stop Worrying Every Time the Wind Picks Up.”

We need more:
• Fear
• Pride
• Regret
• Relief

2. You’re Missing a Clear “Big Idea”

Right now you have angles.

But you don’t yet have a unifying Big Idea.

For example:

You could own:

“Alaska-Proof Outdoor Living”

or

“The No-Horror-Story Contractor”

or

“The 21-Day Alaska Deck System”

One phrase that becomes synonymous with you.

Right now, it’s slightly fragmented.

3. CBO at Launch Is Risky

You suggested CBO from day one.

I’d adjust:

Phase 1:
Use ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization).
Force equal spend across all 4 angles.

Why?

If you start CBO immediately, Meta may:

Spend 70% on one angle prematurely

Starve the others before data matures

After 7–10 days → switch to CBO with winners.

4. You’re Underestimating Retargeting

Your retargeting is too light.

For high-ticket home improvement, retargeting should be aggressive.

You need:

Level 1: Social proof retargeting
Level 2: Objection handling
Level 3: Scarcity + build slot pressure

Example:

Ad:
“You’ve looked at us twice. Here’s what 47 homeowners said.”

Ad:
“Still comparing deck builders? Read this before hiring anyone.”

Ad:
“Only 2 May build slots remain.”

You’re leaving money on the table here.

5. Google Ads Strategy Is Too Basic

High-intent Google is great.

But you’re missing:

• Dedicated landing pages per angle
• Call-only campaigns
• Emergency repair keywords (storm damage, structural repair)
• Display retargeting

Also — competitor campaigns only work if you:

Have aggressive comparison copy

Or pricing advantages

Otherwise it’s expensive ego traffic.

🚀 ADVANCED STRATEGY ADDITIONS

Now let’s level this up.

1️⃣ Add a Fifth Angle: The “Relief” Angle

This is pure contractor fatigue positioning.

Hook:
“Finally… A Contractor That Makes This Easy.”

Script direction:
• No chasing
• No confusion
• No stress
• Just clear communication and finished work

This angle will crush with:
Women homeowners 35–55.

Trust me.

2️⃣ Build a Seasonal Angle Strategy

Alaska gives you a massive opportunity.

Spring:
Urgency + Speed

Mid Summer:
Status + Entertaining

Late Summer:
“Don’t Miss Next Season — Book Now”

Fall:
Structural repair / storm prep

Winter:
Design now, build first in spring

Your messaging should shift with seasons.

3️⃣ Add “Micro-Offers” Instead of Just Consults

Instead of just:

“Book a consultation”

Test:

• Free Structural Safety Inspection
• Free Frost-Heave Assessment
• Free 3D Design Preview
• Free Wind-Resistance Upgrade Quote

Micro-offers convert better than “consultation.”

4️⃣ Add a Cost Anchor Strategy

You’re missing pricing psychology.

For example:

“Most Anchorage homeowners spend $25k–$45k upgrading kitchens.

A custom outdoor living space starts far below that.”

Reframe value.

5️⃣ Add Authority Assets

If possible, add:

• Building code compliance talk
• Load rating explanation
• Engineering partnerships
• Permit handling guarantees

Authority kills skepticism.

🔥 The Big Lever You’re Not Pulling Yet

You are sitting on a goldmine:

“Contractor Horror Story Pattern Interrupt.”

You should run ads like:

“Why 62% of homeowners regret their contractor choice.”

Then:
Break down common failures.
Position Deck Masters as the solution.

That angle alone could dominate.

💣 If I Were Aggressively Scaling This

Here’s what I’d do:

Week 1–2:
Test 5 angles (add Relief angle)

Week 3:
Kill bottom 3.
Double down on top 2.

Week 4:
Introduce:
• UGC versions
• Founder story ad
• “Why We Started Deck Masters” ad

Month 2:
Add:
• Cost objection ads
• Financing-focused creative
• Comparison ads

Month 3:
Launch:
“Book 2026 Now Before Prices Increase”

Scarcity escalates over time.
